√ Sign up: authenticate through Foursquare, log in as that user.
√ Practice scraping all that users checkins.
Put that into the Background on something like delayed job. (I HATE SETTING UP DJ)

√ Create another user.
√ You Authorize this account, and then when it's authorized, and has two accounts, everything is groovy.

Cron:
  √ once per day, we grab the previous 24 hours checkins.
  √ every minute, we see if there's a checkin to make, and if so, we do. (something like a nice "echo_checkin") method

- here's a thought: do we actually cache out the future checkins to another table, so that each minute, we just have to walk file/db and do what it says?


- bug with checkins
Some Checkins have no venue. I've fixed this so venue can be null now. However, what do they have instead? Latlng? Need to investigate and fix up.

### Notes on Foursquare API changes

we need to submit a version with every request. That means:

* upgrading Quimby and reflecting changes to Quimby API
* finding all those things that use RestClient: they probably need changing too
* can the RestClient stuff be upgraded to use Quimby?
* can we upgrade Quimby but NOT the rest of the stack - the stack feels like it needs some specific versioning.
