Sign up: authenticate through Foursquare, log in as that user.
Practice scraping all that users checkins.
Put that into the Background on something like delayed job. (I HATE SETTING UP DJ)

Create another user.
How does Twitshift link the two accounts? (seems to store a cookie of a kidn - ask james)
You Authorize this account, and then when it's authorized, and has two accounts, everything is groovy.

Cron:
  - every morning, we grab the previous 24 hours checkins.
  - every minute, we see if there's a checkin to make, and if so, we do. (something like a nice "echo_checkin") method
