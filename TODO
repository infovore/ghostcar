√ Sign up: authenticate through Foursquare, log in as that user.
√ Practice scraping all that users checkins.
Put that into the Background on something like delayed job. (I HATE SETTING UP DJ)

√ Create another user.
√ You Authorize this account, and then when it's authorized, and has two accounts, everything is groovy.

Cron:
  - once per day, we grab the previous 24 hours checkins.
  - every minute, we see if there's a checkin to make, and if so, we do. (something like a nice "echo_checkin") method

- here's a thought: do we actually cache out the future checkins to another table, so that each minute, we just have to walk file/db and do what it says?
